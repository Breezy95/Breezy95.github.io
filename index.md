        	Hello! I'm Fabrice Benoit. I am a first gen American of Haitian descent, hence the earlier French.
        	I graduated from Stony Brook University in December 2018 receiving my Bachelors in Psychology with a concentration in Mathematics and Computer Science. Currently, I am a graduate student at NYU working towards my masters in Computer Science. In my spare time I enjoy martial arts, competitive video games, skating, weight lifting, and photography.

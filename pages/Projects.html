            </div>
        <div class="col-12 col-sm-8">This was a project that relied primarily on more creative usage of lists, stacks and queues. I used several methods that would help emulate arrival probability of packets, information buffer for the packets and also calculated some basic statistics such as arrival time per packet, maximum and minimum packet size.

        <div class="col-12 col-sm-8">
            This project was made to see if I could come up with some way to bypass the protection that scribd places on its books. This version of it is rudimentary and uses screenshots to capture the information. Later versions will attempt to parse text to recreate a more faithful image of the page

            <h2>Recursive War</h2>
        </div>
    <div class="col-12 col-sm-8">
        This project was made primarily using arrays, hashtables, and several data structures that I made myself to represent pieces of a card game such as the hand,deck, and card itself. Currently the project is capable of running sessions of war recursively through the hand and can draw from the deck but does so automatically. Later versions will allow the viewer to scroll through each round and have a gui.
